      <h2>Account Security</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for safeguarding your eBay account credentials and for ensuring secure access to Autobay. We

      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        Autobay and its code, features, and content are owned by the developer. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive,
        non-transferable right to use the App solely for your own eBay account management.

      </ul>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to Autobay at any time if you violate these Terms, misuse the App, or if
        required by law or by eBay policy. You may stop using Autobay at any time by disconnecting your eBay account.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>
        Autobay is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability,
        accuracy, or error-free operation. Your use of the App is at your sole risk.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Autobay and its developer are not liable for indirect, incidental,
        consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, revenue, or data, arising from use of the App.
      </p>

      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Autobay and its developer from claims, damages, or liabilities arising
        from your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of eBay’s terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of Autobay after changes become effective means you
        accept the revised Terms.
      </p>

        These Terms are governed by the laws of your country of residence, without regard to conflict of laws principles.
